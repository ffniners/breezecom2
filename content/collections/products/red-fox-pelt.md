        text: 'Red Fox Fur certainly knows how to stand out in a crowd. Featuring colors that range from crisp white to bright fiery red-orange, our Red Fox Fur Hide definitely won’t get lost in the shuffle. However, Red Fox Fur isn’t just beautiful, it’s incredibly versatile. Red Fox Fur has been used for hundreds of years by hunters and fisherman to stay warm even in the coldest of temperatures. Consisting of long outer guard hairs that cover a fine and silky underfur, Red Fox Fur is incredibly warm.'
